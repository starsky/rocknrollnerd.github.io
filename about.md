Hi there.

My name is Artem Khurshudov. I'm a Python developer and a Ph.D. student who tries to learn some machine learning and computer vision. This blog contains excersises and implementations, and sometimes occasional thoughts about the subject.

It uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) theme.
